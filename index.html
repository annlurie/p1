<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
<p>I'm a 'nontraditional' student - a Harvard employee taking advantage of basically my favorite employee benefit ever. I work for HUIT (Harvard University IT) as a Lead Project Manager in the Identity and Access Management group. Despite this fact, I cannot do much for you if your PIN credentials suddenly stop working.</p>
<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
<p>This course meets the 'Web Design' requirement for the MS I am (ever-so slowly) pursuing. Also, I quite enjoyed those 5 chapters back in the day, and would love to learn enough to actually implement the ideas I came up with back when my reach utterly exceeded my grasp.</p>
<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
<p>A little bit of grunt-work HTML production as a college intern, CS-50 (Extension School Edition), and 5 chapters of a PHP book. (I worked in a LAMP shop and thought I was actually an auto-didact and that it would make me a better project manager to know how to do other people's jobs.)</p>
<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
<p>Mac!</p>
<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
<p>I'm serious about the PIN thing. Just call the help desk.</p>
